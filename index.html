<td><h3><marquee>HAWAII and Sustainability</marquee></h3>
<p>This study abroad trip was very eye-opening for me. Not only was
going to Hawai’i an amazing adventure and super fun, but I also learned how to
make progress in my personal life (me in HI) as well as
environmentally which is very important.</p>
<p>We need to preserve our planet for future generations and we can
do this by progressing to a greener outlook on life
<p> Progress is the onward movement towards a destination. </p>
<p> So what route can I take to improve my personal progress and
how do I plan to contribute to the progression of sustainability?<p>
<p> <em>“A journey of a 1000 miles starts with one step.”</em></p>
<p> This was my first step towards progress.
It was a leap of faith for me to participate in this study abroad as I
had to step out of my comfort zone. </p>
<p> And I’m glad I did because:
I met some fantastic people and made new friends.
I learned many interesting facts about a culture and their
traditions that are very different from mine.
I realized how fragile our planet is. </p>
<p> With this realization,
I learned that it starts with one person, me, myself and I to be
able to move mountains, cross oceans, and battle red hot lava to
achieve sustainability. </p>
<p> We can do this by maintaining the environment for our future
generations. </p>
<p> There are small things we can do to ensure the survival of plants
and animals
Including:
<b><ul> <li> Leaving only footprints and taking only photos everywhere I go </ul> </li> 

<ul> <li>Using reusable water bottles </ul> </li>
<ul> <li>Participating in service projects </b> </p> </ul> </li>
<p> Since this trip, I have been constantly reminding my friends and
family how important it is to achieve sustainability.
All thanks to this program and Hawaii! </p>
<p> I would call that progress, wouldn’t you? </p>
<p> I will never forget this experience! </p>
<p> It taught me how important sustainability truly is and I now take
that into consideration in my daily life.
As far as personal progress I learned that it is worth it to take that
leap as you never know the exciting places it might take you!</p>

<p>Hey, it might even take you to Hawaii! </p>
